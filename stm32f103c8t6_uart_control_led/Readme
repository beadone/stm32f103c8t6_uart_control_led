An eclipse project for a STM32f103c8t6 arm system.

Will initialise the uart1 and 2 pins on an stm32f103c8t6 development board and wait for key strokes from the keyboard and replay them. 
It also blinks pc13 so you know all is working. 

this project is built on the PA13 blink program.
 It is the default program when creating a basic "hello world" for the stm32f103.

You can download the whole project and import it into eclipse.
